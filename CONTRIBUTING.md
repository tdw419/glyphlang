## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a branch for your changes
5. Make your changes and test them
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Git

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GlyphLang.git
cd GlyphLang

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GlyphLang/GlyphLang.git

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the CLI
go build -o glyph ./cmd/glyph

# Verify the build
./glyph version
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./pkg/parser/...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```

### Running Linters

```bash
# Run go vet
go vet ./...

# Run golangci-lint (if installed)
golangci-lint run
```

## Making Changes

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting work:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits

4. **Test your changes** thoroughly

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` to format code (run automatically on save in most editors)
- Run `go vet` before committing
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add comments for exported functions, types, and non-obvious logic
- Handle errors explicitly; avoid ignoring error returns

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for unexported identifiers
- Use PascalCase for exported identifiers
- Use descriptive names that convey purpose
- Avoid single-letter names except for loop indices or very short scopes

### File Organization

- One package per directory
- Test files should be named `*_test.go`
- Keep related functionality together

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    InputType
        expected OutputType
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {"valid input", validInput, expectedOutput, false},
        {"invalid input", invalidInput, OutputType{}, true},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := FunctionName(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("unexpected error: %v", err)
            }
            if !reflect.DeepEqual(got, tt.expected) {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, include:

- GlyphLang version (`glyph version`)
- Operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Minimal code example if applicable
- Error messages or stack traces

### Security Issues

For security vulnerabilities, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private security reporting feature.

## Issue Labels

We use a structured labeling system to help contributors find appropriate work and to track issue status. You can filter issues by labels on the GitHub Issues page.

### Finding Issues by Skill Level

**New to GlyphLang?** Start with these labels:

- `good-first-issue` - Issues specifically curated for newcomers. These typically have clear requirements, limited scope, and include guidance on where to start.
- `difficulty:beginner` - Issues that require minimal familiarity with the codebase.

**Ready for more?** Look for:

- `difficulty:intermediate` - Issues that require familiarity with the codebase structure and conventions.
- `help-wanted` - Issues where maintainers are actively seeking community contributions.

**Experienced contributors** can tackle:

- `difficulty:advanced` - Complex issues requiring deep knowledge of the system architecture.

### Label Categories

#### Type Labels

Indicate what kind of work the issue involves:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type:bug` | Something is not working as expected |
| `type:feature` | New functionality or capability |
| `type:enhancement` | Improvement to existing functionality |
| `type:refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `type:test` | Adding or improving tests |
| `type:performance` | Performance improvement or optimization |

#### Area Labels

Indicate which part of the codebase is affected:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `area:parser` | Parser and syntax analysis |
| `area:compiler` | Compiler and code generation |
| `area:vm` | Virtual machine |
| `area:interpreter` | Interpreter |
| `area:server` | Glyph server |
| `area:lsp` | Language Server Protocol implementation |
| `area:cli` | Command-line interface |
| `area:database` | Database functionality |
| `area:security` | Security features and concerns |
| `area:docs` | Documentation |

#### Priority Labels

Indicate urgency:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `priority:low` | Nice to have but not urgent |
| `priority:medium` | Should be addressed in the near term |
| `priority:high` | Important issue requiring prompt attention |
| `priority:critical` | Must be addressed immediately |

#### Status Labels

Indicate current state:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `status:ready` | Ready to be worked on |
| `status:in-progress` | Currently being worked on |
| `status:blocked` | Blocked by another issue or external factor |
| `status:needs-info` | Requires more information from reporter |

### Tips for Contributors

1. **Combine filters** - Use multiple labels to find the perfect issue. For example, filter by `good-first-issue` AND `area:parser` to find beginner-friendly parser issues.

2. **Check status first** - Look for `status:ready` issues that are not already assigned.

3. **Comment before starting** - Leave a comment on the issue to let maintainers know you are working on it. This prevents duplicate effort.

4. **Ask questions** - If an issue is unclear, add a comment asking for clarification rather than guessing.
